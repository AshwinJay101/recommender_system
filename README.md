In this project, our goal was to utilize the Movielens datasets and build a system that recommended movies to users' behaviors.
We achieved this by implementing two collaborative filtering recommender systems (one memory-based & one model-based) using the scikit-surprise library in Python.

Memory-based Algorithms + Tests
-------------------------------
knn_tests_100k.py: The source code to implement the KNN algorithms in Surprise (using 100k dataset) and 
run the grid search tests to find optimal hyperparameters for each algorithm.
KNNBaselineTests.py: The source code used to analyze performance of our chosen memory-based algorithm (KNN Baseline) against
larger datasets.
